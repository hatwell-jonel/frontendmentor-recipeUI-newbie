            <li> <b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
            <li> <b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
              the eggs evenly coat the surface.

              <b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
              middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
              fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
